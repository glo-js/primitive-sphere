[(demo)](http://glo-js.github.io/primitive-sphere/)

A minimal UV sphere geometry for 3D rendering, including normals, UVs and cell indices. The algorithm has been adapted from [BabylonJS](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js).

## Example

```js
var radius = 1
var mesh = require('primitive-sphere')(radius, {
  segments: 16
})

// the simplicial complex
console.log(mesh.positions, mesh.cells)

// rendering attributes
console.log(mesh.uvs)
console.log(mesh.normals)
```

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/primitive-sphere.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/primitive-sphere)

#### `mesh = sphere(radius, [opt])`

Creates a new UV sphere mesh with the given `radius` (default 1) and options:

- `segments` number of segments to use, defaults to 32

The returned mesh is a simplicial complex with the following data:

```
{
  positions: [ [x, y, z], [x, y, z], ... ],
  cells: [ [a, b, c], [a, b, c], ... ],
  uvs: [ [u, v], [u, v], ... ],
  normals: [ [x, y, z], [x, y, z], ... ]
}
```
